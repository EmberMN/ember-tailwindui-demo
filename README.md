# ember-tailwindui-demo

Repository for TailwindUI demo/talk at EmberMN meetup:
https://www.meetup.com/EmberMN/events/271954553/

Note: due to [licensing restrictions](https://www.notion.so/Tailwind-UI-License-644418bb34ad4fa29aac9b82e956a867),
I cannot publish the source templates/HTML code for most of the TailwindUI components
(these are what Tailwind Labs' customers, such as myself, pay for).
However, they do [offer some "free sample components"](https://tailwindui.com/preview), so I'll use these for this demo.
Furthermore, Tailwind Labs [hired](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/simon-vrachliotis-joins-tailwind-labs)
some [people](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/from-900-to-1-how-we-hired-robin-malfait)
recently and appears to be interested in expanding their offerings to include Vue & React components rather than just static HTML examples.  
A few days ago I tried to reach [Robin Malfait](https://github.com/RobinMalfait) via email about the possibility of providing an ember addon as well, but so far I have not received any reply. 

My notes/outline can be found in [`MEETUP.md`](MEETUP.md)
