## Welcome / housekeeping / announcements

* Chat with us on the [Ember.js community Discord server](https://discord.gg/emberjs);
  the `#us-twin-cities` channel (found in "Locations" group) was made precisely for this purpose!
* Sorry we don't have food or beverages to share tonight due to virtual format.
* Serious note: although this is a technical meetup and is being facilitated online, we're all human and live in a physical world.
  As most are well aware, there are a lot of troubling things happening right now: a pandemic, racial injustice, political skulduggery, etc.
  Personally I (jacobq) often feel somewhat powerless to help remedy these deep issues, but that seems a lame excuse not to at least try.
  One thing that I've been learning (especially while reading [White Fragility: Why It's So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism](https://www.amazon.com/White-Fragility-People-About-Racism/dp/0807047414))
  is that I, along with the rest of my fellow whites, can inadvertently cause others harm even while having the best of intentions.
  So I would like to humbly welcome feedback from anyone (but especially blacks and people of color) regarding how I might be able to improve in this area.
  I will endeavor to listen, not become defensive, and take your input into consideration.
  I believe that as more people adopt this mindset it will be easier to understand societal problems and live at peace with each other.
  I want everyone to feel welcome in the EmberMN meetup, in the web development community, and in the field of science and engineering as a whole.
* Call for volunteers: I (jacobq) would love for someone else to organize a meeting in the next few months. 
  I need to finish my MS thesis this fall as otherwise I will get dropped, so I'm not planning to volunteer much until 2021.
* If anyone's curious about the little app I mentioned making, it was for a project that was presented
  as part of a poster session at [SIGCOMM'20](http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2020/program.html) last week,
  and you can stop by the virtual ([Mozilla Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com/))) [room here](https://hubs.mozilla.com/qffoETt/5g-tracker/)
  to see
* Questions / concerns before starting?
