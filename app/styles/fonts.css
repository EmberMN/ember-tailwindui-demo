/*
If we import this by resolving directly to `node_modules` like this:
@import "typeface-inter/Inter (web)/inter.css";
then the resulting CSS will contain relative URLs that look for the font
at the wrong URL (/assets/ instead of /assets/fonts/inter/).
However, since PostCSS doesn't know about the fonts that ember-cli (broccoli)
will copy to dist/assets/... the postcss-import plugin would throw an error
when it tries to find the file below (since it runs before the file gets copied there),
so we configure it to ignore this import using its `filter` option in ember-cli-build.js.

@import "fonts/inter/inter.css";
